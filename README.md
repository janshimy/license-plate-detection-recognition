# license-plate-detection-recognition

This project showcases a solution for automatic plate number detection. 
This solution is unique and innovative as it doesn't rely on heavy computation on the tasks like license plate detection, license plate extraction, characters slicing, and extraction.
Applied deep learning/Convolutional Neural Network technique is used for character recognition with lightweight computation needed. This makes the solution suitable to run on edge devices and only simpler infrastructure is required.
